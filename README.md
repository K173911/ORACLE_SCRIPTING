# ORACLE_SCRIPTING
Are you looking to insert a large amount of data into an Oracle database? Look no further! My script is designed to efficiently insert millions of data points, each with custom information for each column.

To start, we recommend creating a sequence. For example:
"CREATE SEQUENCE CustID
INCREMENT BY 1
START WITH 1
MAXVALUE 1000000"

This allows you to easily control the number of data points being inserted and the increment rate. You can even adjust the maxvalue to suit your specific needs. With this script, inserting bulk data into your Oracle database has never been easier. Give it a try today!
